This is my "Play with JavaScript" - assignment.

I got the random backgrounds from desktoppr.
Their webpage is here: https://www.desktoppr.co/api

My initial idea was to "scratch" the top layor to reveal a
random image at the back. In the end I was only able to remove
color- blocks to reveal the image.
